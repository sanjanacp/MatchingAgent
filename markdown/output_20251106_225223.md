Okay, I understand. I will proceed with finding the top 5 advisers for the given Form D accession.

Here's my plan:

1.  **Query `vw_investor_deal_scored`**: I will select the specified columns (`adviser_id`, `adviser_name`, `adviser_city`, `adviser_state`, `total_raum`, `composite_score`, `geography_score`, `capital_score`, `audience_score`) from the `vw_investor_deal_scored` view.
2.  **Filter by `deal_id`**: I will filter the results using the provided Form D accession number, formatted as `FD:0000005108-25-000002` for the `deal_id` column.
3.  **Order and Limit**: I will order the results by `composite_score` in descending order and limit the output to the top 5.
4.  **Explain Fit**: For each adviser, I will provide a brief explanation of why they are a good fit based on their scores.
Here are the top 5 advisers for Form D accession 0000005108-25-000002, based on their composite scores:
